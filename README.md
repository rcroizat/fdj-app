# Hello


To run this app, first let's go to /back

npm install

import and launch your mongodb data base (i named it fdjdb)

finally => node app.js

The app is running on port :3000

Then go to /front folder 

npm install 

ng serve -o 

## You need node > 12 to work with commonJS import 

(e.g => import express from 'express')

## The database must be named fdjdb
